# Closeness-Centrality
Computing the closeness centrality for all vertices in an unweighted network.

Input: from the command line the name of the edge list file of an undirected graph. 
For example:

python Closeness_Centrality.py MyGraph.txt

As usual, the vertices in the edge list file are labeled with values between 0 and|V|-1.

Output: to the standard output the closeness centralities (Eq. 7.29 of Newman 2010) of all vertices with their indices:

[0]  0.37326

[1]  1.07425

[2]  0.27836

[3]  2.62004
